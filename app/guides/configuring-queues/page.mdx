# Configuring Queues

When specifying a queue, you can optionally pass in some options along with the queue object to customize the queue's behavior.

There's currently 3 options you can customize:

1. `maxAttempts` - Default is 1. Increasing this means your job will be retried until `currentAttempt <= maxAttempts`.
2. `payloadTransformer` - Transform the payload before it's inserted into the database and when it's retrieved from the database.
3. `pollingInterval` - Default is 2 seconds. This is the interval at which sidetrack will poll your database for new jobs.

## maxAttempts

By increasing the `maxAttempts` for a job, you are allowing the job to be retried in the future. All jobs have a default `maxAttempts` of 1, so if you want a job to run at most 5 times before being marked as failed, you can set maxAttempts to 5.

```ts twoslash
import { Sidetrack } from "sidetrack";

const sidetrack = new Sidetrack<{
  userOnboarding: { email: string };
}>({
  databaseOptions: {
    connectionString: process.env["DATABASE_URL"]!,
  },
  queues: {
    userOnboarding: {
      run: async (payload, context) => {
        throw new Error("intentionally failing job");
      },
      maxAttempts: 5,
      // ^?
    },
  },
});

sidetrack.start();

sidetrack.insertJob("userOnboarding", { email: "a@example.com" });
```

This job will fail on the first run then move to `retrying` status since its `currentAttempt` (1) is less than 5. After 5 attempts, the job will transition to a status of `failed`.

## payloadTransformer

The `payloadTransformer` option allows you to transform the payload before it's inserted into the database and when it's retrieved from the database.

```ts twoslash
// @noErrors
import { Sidetrack } from "sidetrack";
import superjson from "superjson";

const sidetrack = new Sidetrack<{
  userOnboarding: { registeredAt: Date };
}>({
  databaseOptions: {
    connectionString: process.env["DATABASE_URL"]!,
  },
  // Transform Date objects when saving to and loading from the database
  payloadTransformer: {
    serialize: (payload) => superjson.stringify(payload),
    deserialize: (payload) => superjson.deserialize(payload),
  },
  queues: {
    userOnboarding: {
      run: async (payload) => {
        // payload.registeredAt is a Date object, not a string
        console.log(`User registered at ${payload.registeredAt.toISOString()}`);
      },
    },
  },
});

sidetrack.start();

// Date objects are automatically handled by the transformer
sidetrack.insertJob("userOnboarding", { registeredAt: new Date() });
```

By default, when storing job payloads in the database, they are serialized to JSON. This works fine for simple objects, but can cause issues with special types like `Date` objects which get converted to strings. Using a `payloadTransformer`, you can customize how the payload is serialized and deserialized.

In this example, we use [superjson](https://github.com/blitz-js/superjson) to handle the transformation. This allows us to work with `Date` objects directly in our job handlers, while ensuring they are properly stored in the database.

## pollingInterval

The `pollingInterval` option allows you to customize the interval at which sidetrack will poll your database for new jobs. It can be set on the queue level or the sidetrack instance level.

```ts twoslash
import { Sidetrack } from "sidetrack";

const sidetrack = new Sidetrack<{
  userOnboarding: { email: string };
}>({
  databaseOptions: {
    connectionString: process.env["DATABASE_URL"]!,
  },
  queues: {
    userOnboarding: {
      run: async (payload, context) => {
        throw new Error("intentionally failing job");
      },
      pollingInterval: 3000, // 3 seconds
      // ^?
    },
  },
  pollingInterval: 5000, // 5 seconds
  // ^?
});

sidetrack.start();

sidetrack.insertJob("userOnboarding", { email: "a@example.com" });
```
