# Configuring Queues

When specifying a queue, you can optionally pass an `options` object to customize the queue's behavior.
There's currently 1 option you can customize:

1. `maxAttempts` - Default is 1. Increasing this means your job will be retried until `currentAttempt <= maxAttempts`.

## maxAttempts

By increasing the `maxAttempts` for a job, you are allowing the job to be retried in the future. All jobs have a default `maxAttempts` of 1, so if you want a job to run at most 5 times before being marked as failed, you can set maxAttempts to 5.

```ts twoslash
import { Sidetrack } from "sidetrack";

const sidetrack = new Sidetrack<{
  userOnboarding: { email: string };
}>({
  databaseOptions: {
    connectionString: process.env["DATABASE_URL"]!,
  },
  queues: {
    userOnboarding: {
      handler: async (job) => {
        throw new Error("intentionally failing job");
      },
      options: {
        maxAttempts: 5,
        // ^?
      },
    },
  },
});

sidetrack.start();

sidetrack.insertJob("userOnboarding", { email: "a@example.com" });
```

This job will fail on the first run then move to `retrying` status since its `currentAttempt` (1) is less than 5. After 5 attempts, the job will transition to a status of `failed`.
