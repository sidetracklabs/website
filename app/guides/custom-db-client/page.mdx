# Custom database clients

## Included clients

We have support for two clients:

1. [pg](https://npmjs.com/package/pg) (included with `sidetrack`)

2. [prisma](https://npmjs.com/package/prisma) (install `@sidetrack/client-prisma`)

The `pg` client can be used as follows:

```ts twoslash
import { usePg, Sidetrack } from "sidetrack";
import { Pool } from "pg";

// You can also use a pg.Client instead of a pg.Pool
const pool = new Pool();

const sidetrack = new Sidetrack<{
  userOnboarding: { email: string };
}>({
  databaseOptions: {
    connectionString: process.env["DATABASE_URL"]!,
  },
  queues: {
    userOnboarding: {
      run: async (payload, context) => {
        console.log(`Welcome ${payload.email}`);
      },
    },
  },
  // This will apply to all methods available on sidetrack
  dbClient: usePg(pool),
});

// You can also override the connection per method
sidetrack.insertJob(
  "userOnboarding",
  { email: "hello@example.com" },
  {
    dbClient: usePg(pool),
  },
);
```

Similarly, the `@sidetrack/client-prisma` package exposes a `usePrisma` function that can be used to create a client that works with prisma. You can find the documentation for it [here](https://sidetracklabs.github.io/sidetrack/functions/_sidetrack_client-prisma.usePrisma.html).

<Callout>
  With this custom client, you can now run most of the functions that are
  available within the `Sidetrack` class in a transaction. Pass in a client
  that's running within a transaction, and it "just works"!
</Callout>

## Creating your own client

Sidetrack is designed to support working with your database client library of choice, as long as it works with the databases that are supported by sidetrack. To do this, you need to implement the `SidetrackDatabaseClient` interface, which you can find [here](https://sidetracklabs.github.io/sidetrack/interfaces/sidetrack.index.SidetrackDatabaseClient.html). It currently has one method called `execute`.

For example, you can find the implementation of the `usePg` function [here](https://github.com/sidetracklabs/sidetrack/blob/main/packages/sidetrack/src/client.ts#L18)
