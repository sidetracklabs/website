# Running migrations

Migrations will automatically be run when you call `sidetrack.start()`.

The migrations create a few tables in your database, like `sidetrack_jobs` and `sidetrack_cron_jobs`.

If you want to manually run the migrations, call `runMigrations` with your database connection string.

```ts twoslash
import { runMigrations } from "sidetrack";

await runMigrations(process.env["DATABASE_URL"]!);
```
