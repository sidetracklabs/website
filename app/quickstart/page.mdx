# Quickstart

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to add Sidetrack to your project and run your first job.

1. Install using your package manager of choice.

```sh npm2yarn
npm i sidetrack
```

```ts twoslash include main
import { Sidetrack } from "sidetrack";

const sidetrack = new Sidetrack<{
  userOnboarding: { email: string };
}>({
  databaseOptions: {
    connectionString: process.env["DATABASE_URL"]!,
  },
  queues: {
    userOnboarding: {
      run: async (payload, context) => {
        console.log(`Welcome ${payload.email}!`);
      },
    },
  },
});
```

2. Import it into your project, and initialize Sidetrack by defining your queues.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  Please note that we only support PostgreSQL at the moment.
</Callout>

```ts twoslash
// @include: main

sidetrack.start(); // starts listening for new jobs in your DB
```

Notice how you pass in the types for your queues, specifying your queueName as the key (`userOnboarding`), and the value being the type for your job's payload (`{email: string}`).

To insert a job, use the insertJob function to specify the queue and the job payload.

```ts twoslash
// @include: main
// ---cut---
sidetrack.insertJob("userOnboarding", { email: "a@example.com" });
```

Once the job is inserted, Sidetrack will pick it up and run it. You should see a log in your terminal!

```console
Welcome a@example.com!
```

You are ready to continue your Sidetrack journey! Good luck (and don't get sidetracked)!
