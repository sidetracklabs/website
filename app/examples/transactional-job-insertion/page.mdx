## Insert a job within a transaction

One huge advantage of being a database-backed library is that we can insert jobs transactionally!
This means that if you are in the middle of a transaction and your transaction fails, your job will be rolled back.

For example, say your application logic wants to send a email once a user is created. Here's a Prisma example to insert a job transactionally with Sidetrack's `usePrisma` function:

```ts twoslash
// @noErrors
import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client";

import { Sidetrack } from "sidetrack";

import { usePrisma } from "@sidetrack/client-prisma";

const prisma = new PrismaClient();

const sidetrack = new Sidetrack<{
  userOnboarding: { email: string };
}>({
  databaseOptions: {
    databaseUrl: process.env["DATABASE_URL"]!,
  },
  queues: {
    userOnboarding: {
      run: async (payload, context) => {
        console.log(`Welcome ${payload.email}`);
      },
    },
  },
});

// In this transaction, we're creating both the user and background job
prisma.$transaction(async (prismaTx) => {
  const user = await prismaTx.user.create(/* create your user */);
  return sidetrack.insertJob(
    "userOnboarding",
    {
      email: user.email,
    },
    { dbClient: usePrisma(prismaTx) },
  );
});

// if you run other application code which fails, the entire transaction will rollback
// and neither the job nor user will be inserted!
prisma.$transaction(async (prismaTx) => {
  const user = await prismaTx.user.create(/* create your user */);
  await sidetrack.insertJob(
    "userOnboarding",
    {
      email: user.email,
    },
    { dbClient: usePrisma(prismaTx) },
  );
  throw new Error("Something went wrong");
});
```
