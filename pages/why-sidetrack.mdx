# Why Sidetrack?

## Motivation

After working on a handful of applications, we couldn't find a library in the TypeScript/JavaScript ecosystem for working with background jobs that was database-backed and TypeScript-first. The most popular job processing libraries in the ecosystem use Redis, which is a great tool, but we wanted to use a database that we were already using in our applications. We wanted to be able to use TypeScript to define our jobs and have a great developer experience. Additionally, databases allow for transactional guarantees, so we can avoid inserting jobs into the queue if the transaction fails.

Our focus is on relational databases, namely PostgreSQL, but we are open to supporting other relational databases in the future. This would make us the first database-backed job processing library in the Node.js ecosystem that we know of to support more than PostgreSQL.

We love using [Effect-TS](https://effect.website/), and had to create internal wrappers around other libraries to make them work with Effect-TS. We wanted to create a library that was built with Effect in mind, and that would allow us to use Effect.

This is the first open-source project we've worked on together, and we're excited to share it with you!
