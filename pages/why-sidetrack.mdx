# Motivation

After working on a handful of applications, we noticed that we couldn't find a library in TypeScript/JavaScript ecosystem for working with background jobs that was database-backed and TypeScript-first. The most popular job processing libraries in the Node.js ecosystem use Redis, which is a great tool, but we wanted to use a database that we were already using in our applications. We also wanted to be able to use TypeScript to define our jobs and have a great developer experience. Additionally, databases allow for transactional guarantees, so we can avoid inserting jobs into the queue if the transaction fails. 

Our focus is on relational databases, namely PostgreSQL, but we are open to supporting other databases in the future. This would make us the first database-backed job processing library in the Node.js ecosystem that we know of to support more than PostgreSQL.
