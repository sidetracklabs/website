Sidetrack is a new way to manage background jobs in your TypeScript backend. It's meant to a database-backed alternative to Redis-backed job queues, and a TypeScript-first alternative compared to other database-backed job queues. We're currently in the early stages of development, but we're excited to share our progress with you.

Please give it a try and let us know what you think! We're excited to get feedback and suggestions from the community.
