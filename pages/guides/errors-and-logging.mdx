# Error and Logging

Whenever Sidetrack encounters an unhandled exception while running your job, the error and stack trace will be appended to the `errors` field for that job, and the job will be marked as failed (or retrying if more attempts are available).

While you can always refer to the `errors` field on the job to see what went wrong, you should consider adding logs.

```ts twoslash
// @noErrors
import { Sidetrack, SidetrackJobWithPayload } from "sidetrack";

const onboardUser = async (job: SidetrackJobWithPayload<{ email: string }>) => {
  try {
    // do something
  } catch (error) {
    logger.error(`Job ${job.id} failed`);
    // does this error need to be serialized?
    logger.error(error);
    throw error;
  }
};

const sidetrack = new Sidetrack<{
  userOnboarding: { email: string };
}>({
  databaseOptions: {
    connectionString: process.env["DATABASE_URL"]!,
  },
  queues: {
    userOnboarding: {
      handler: onboardUser,
      options: {
        maxAttempts: 5,
      },
    },
  },
});
```
