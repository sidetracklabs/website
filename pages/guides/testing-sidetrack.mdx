# Testing Sidetrack

Sidetrack provides multiple test utilities function under the SidetrackTest class.

The SidetrackTest class extends all the functions under Sidetrack, but also exposes these helpful utils:

1. runJob
2. runQueue
3. listJobs
4. listJobStatuses

Here's some common scenarios when testing your background jobs.

## Running a job

In your tests, if you don't run sidetrack.start(), then Sidetrack won't poll your database for new jobs.
You can manually run a job with the runJob function.

```ts twoslash
import { SidetrackTest } from "sidetrack";
import { expect, it } from "vitest";

it("job runs", async () => {
  const sidetrack = new SidetrackTest<{
    userOnboarding: { email: string };
  }>({
    databaseOptions: {
      connectionString: process.env["DATABASE_URL"]!,
    },
    queues: {
      userOnboarding: {
        handler: async (job) => {
          console.log("ran job")
        }
      },
    },
  });
  
  const job = await sidetrack.insertJob("userOnboarding", { email: "a@example.com" });
  // this job stays in scheduled and won't be run because we haven't run sidetrack.start()
  expect((await sidetrack.getJob(job.id)).status).toBe("scheduled")
  
  // You decide when to run the job
  await sidetrack.runJob(job.id)
  expect((await sidetrack.getJob(job.id)).status).toBe("completed")
})

```
## Running jobs in a queue

While runJob only allows you to run a single job, often you may want to run all the jobs on a queue.

```ts twoslash
// @noErrors

// You can run jobs on a single queue
await sidetrack.runQueue("userOnboarding"); 
```

By default, runQueue runs jobs that are scheduled in the past or present. If you want to include future jobs you may pass an option for `{includeFutureJobs: true}`

```ts twoslash
// @noErrors
// Will run all jobs on this queue, including ones with scheduledAt in the future
await sidetrack.runQueue("userOnboarding", {includeFutureJobs: true}); 
```


## Listing jobs

You may want to assert that certain jobs exist on a queue(s).
listJob accepts a single queue or list of queues, and returns a list of jobs.

```ts twoslash
// @noErrors

await sidetrack.insert("userOnboarding", {email: "a@example.com"}); 
await sidetrack.insert("userOnboarding", {email: "b@example.com"}); 

// You can run jobs on a single queue
const jobs = await sidetrack.listJobs("userOnboarding"); 
expect(jobs.length).toBe(2)
```


## Listing job statuses

listJobStatuses provides a convenient way to know the breadown of all the jobs and their statuses.

```ts twoslash
// @noErrors

const job1 = await sidetrack.insert("userOnboarding", {email: "a@example.com"}); 
await sidetrack.insert("userOnboarding", {email: "b@example.com"}); 
await sidetrack.runJob(job1.id); 

// we should expect 1 job to be in completed, another job to be in scheduled
const jobs = await sidetrack.listJobsStatuses("userOnboarding"); 
expect(jobs).toBeObject({scheduled: 1, completed: 1})
```
