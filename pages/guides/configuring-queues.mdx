# Configuring Queues

When specifying a queue, you can optionally pass a `options` object to customize the queue's behavior.
There's currently only 1 option you can customize:

1. `maxAttempts` - Default is 1. Increasing this means your job will be retried until `currentAttempt <= maxAttempts`.

## maxAttempts

By increasing the `maxAttempts` for a job, you are allowing the job to be retried in the future. All jobs have a default `maxAttempts` of 1, so if you want a job to run at most 5 times before being marked as failed, you can set maxAttempts to 5.

```ts twoslash
import { Sidetrack } from "sidetrack";

const sidetrack = new Sidetrack<{
  userOnboarding: { email: string };
}>({
  databaseOptions: {
    connectionString: process.env["DATABASE_URL"]!,
  },
  queues: {
    userOnboarding: {
      handler: async (job) => {
        throw new Error("intentionally failing job");
      },
      options: {
        maxAttempts: 5,
      },
    },
  },
});

sidetrack.start();

sidetrack.insertJob("userOnboarding", { email: "a@example.com" });
```

This job will fail on the first run, and move to retrying status since its `currentAttempt` (1) is less than 5. After 5 attempts, the job will transition to a status of `failed`.

## uniqueOn

2. uniqueOn - Used to enforce uniqueness before inserting a job on the queue.
3. backoff - The strategy used for retrying jobs. Default is exponential backoff inspired by Resque.

You can enforce job uniqueness in the following ways:
payloadKeys, scheduledAt, status
