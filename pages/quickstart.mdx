# Quickstart

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to add Sidetrack to your project and run your first job.

1. Install using npm

```bash filename="Terminal"
npm install sidetrack
```

```twoslash include main
import { Sidetrack } from "sidetrack";

const sidetrack = new Sidetrack<{
      userOnboarding: { email: string }
    }>({
      databaseOptions: {
        connectionString: process.env["DATABASE_URL"]!
      },
      queues: {
        userOnboarding: {
          handler: async (job) => {
            console.log(`Welcome ${job.payload.email}`)
          },
        },
      },
    });
```

2. Import it into your project, and initialize Sidetrack by defining your queues

```ts twoslash
// @include: main

sidetrack.start(); // starts listening for new jobs in your DB
```

Notice how you pass in the types for your queues, specifying your queueName as the key (`userOnboarding`), and the value being the type for your job's payload (`{email: string}`).

To insert a job, use the insertJob function to specify the queue and the job payload.

```ts twoslash
// @include: main
// ---cut---
sidetrack.insertJob("userOnboarding", { email: "a@example.com" });
```

Once the job is inserted, Sidetrack will pick it up and run it. You should see a log in your terminal!

```console
Hello a@example.com!
```

You are ready to continue your sidetrack journey! Good luck and don't get sidetracked!

## More on types

Notice how the types you defined above prevent you from inserting an invalid job.

```ts twoslash
// @include: main
// ---cut---
// @errors: 2345
sidetrack.insertJob("userOnboarding", { phone: "11111111111" });
```
